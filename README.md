###Details

The Selma and Wang mobile web app with a responsive design also suited to tablets and desktop devices.

The app contains two main sections, the ""Dreamtime Adventure"" Visual Experience and the "Hear Color" Audio Experience.

In the [Dreamtime Adventure](app.selmaandwang.com), visitors are asked to react to different sections of the installation by choosing a color displayed on the app. Their color selection is represented as a new dot that appears on the screen. Leveraging the power of Firebase's live syncing, their selection also appears on the screen of all other active users. 

In this way, visitors to the gallery create their own collaborative, living art piece that is projected onto the walls of the installation space.

In the [Hear Color Audio Experience](app.selmaandwang.com/music-player), visitors listen to a piece of music and are prompted to choose a color that matches their mood at that moment. Designed as a sort of "synesthesia simulator", the visitor's color selections create a "patch" that is added to a virtual "quilt" of all users' patches.

This quilt is also projected onto the gallery walls and grows organically, utlizing Firebase, as visitors add their patches.

###Story Synopsis 

Selma, 12, survivor of an engineering disaster, finds under her bed, a cute, yet very powerful monster called Wang that shows her how to travel from Realtime to Dreamtime, until one night they both get stuck in between and they have to combine their creative minds to go back to an new Reality.
